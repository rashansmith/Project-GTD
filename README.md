# Project-GTD
Data Analysis and Prediction Models for Global Terrorism Data using R.

The project goes through the entire  CRISP-DM process:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preperation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment

The project was done as a part of my Data Science course, and was a great way to learn about the CRISP-DM Process as well as different machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes. I hope to apply these skills in more interdisciplinary projects in the future.
