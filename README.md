# Project-GTD
Data Analysis and Prediction Models for Global Terrorism Data using R.

The project goes through the entire  CRISP-DM process:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preperation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment

The project did not result in accurate prediction models, but the project was a great way to understand the CRISP-DM 
process.
